  <p> Since launching our first prototype platform in early 2023, we've been committed to our goal of widening the access to professional maths help and resources for HSC students across Australia.</p>

   <p> We've seen first hand how expensive getting additional support for maths can be in NSW, with many tutoring companies charging exorbitant fees every term just to work in a classroom with 20 other students. Additionally, there were little to no effective alternatives, as many math textbooks and resources don't simulate exam questions nor provide written solutions.
</p>

    <p> With a focus on empowering HSC students to learn beyond the classroom, we believe our platform can help students to properly prepare for their exams and gain the confidence needed to achieve the ATAR they want.</p>

  <p>We thank everyone who has supported us on our journey so far, especially those who have provided the feedback necessary to continuously improve our platform.</p>

   <p> With the launch of our completely revamped platform, our future goals involve further improvements and software features which will be beneficial for our students. We are focusing on developing further student analytics, exam performance data and AI - generated feedback features, so stay tuned for these!
</p>

    <p>On the content side, we will continue to upgrade, improve and add to our Maths Advanced course, including more questions, booklets and exam sets. We now have our sights set on completing the Maths Extension 1 course, building up the Maths Standard and developing the Maths Extension 2 courses. </p>

    <p> As our website grows, so will our team, so if you or someone you know may be interested in joining us, contact us at contact@mathifyhsc.com.au to let us know and we'll be in touch. </p>
