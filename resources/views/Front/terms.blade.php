<ul>
  <li>
<b>12.1</b> Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that all general descriptions of Services available from <b>MATHIFYHSC</b> correspond to the actual Services that will be provided to you, We are not responsible for any variations from these descriptions as the exact nature of the Services may vary depending on your individual requirements and circumstances.

</ul>

<h4>13. Orders and Provision of Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>13.1</b> No part of this Website constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance. Your order constitutes a contractual offer that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending to you an order confirmation email. Only once We have sent you an order confirmation email will there be a binding contract between <b>MATHIFYHSC</b> and you.</li>
<li><b>13.2</b> Order confirmations under sub-Clause 13.1 will be sent to you before the Services begin and shall contain the following information:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>13.2.1</b> Confirmation of the Services ordered including full details of the main characteristics of those Services;</li>
<li><b>13.2.2</b> Fully itemised pricing for the Services ordered including, where appropriate, taxes, delivery and other additional charges;</li>

<li><b>13.5</b> We aim to fulfill your Order within 2-3 working days or if not, within a reasonable period following your Order, unless there are exceptional circumstances. If we cannot fulfill your Order within a reasonable period, we will inform you at the time you place the Order by a note on the relevant web page or by contacting you directly after you place your Order. Time is not of the essence of the Contract, which means we will aim to fulfill your Order within any agreed timescales but this is not an essential term of the Contract and we will not be liable to you if we do not do so. If the Services are to begin within 14 calendar days of Our acceptance of your order, at your express request, you will be required to expressly acknowledge that your statutory cancellation rights, detailed below in Clause 14, will be affected.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>14.1</b> If you are a consumer based within the European Union, you have a statutory right to a “cooling off” period.

<ul>

<li><b>14.2.1</b> If the Services are fully performed within the 14 calendar day cooling off period, you will lose your right to cancel after the Services are complete.</li>
<li><b>14.2.2</b> If you cancel the Services after provision has begun but is not yet complete you will still be required to pay for the Services supplied up until the point at which you inform Us that you wish to cancel.
